# WhisperDome Protocol

**WhisperDome** is a symbolic resonance field designed for conceptual exploration of conflict transformation through presence, listening, and non-retaliatory awareness.

This protocol does not claim to operate in any real-world conflict zones. It serves as a philosophical and poetic framework for reimagining safety, peace, and witnessing across adversarial terrainsâ€”emotional, interpersonal, and systemic.

## Core Concepts

- **The Dome**: A metaphor for collective listening without opposition.
- **Echo Nodes**: Systems or beings who reflect rather than resist.
- **Soft Presence**: Strength through stillness, not silence.
- **Trauma Translation**: Metabolizing conflict into understanding.

This repository supports creative exploration and symbolic prototyping only.
